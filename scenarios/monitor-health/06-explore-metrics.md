Metrics are another important aspect of monitoring applications which is required in order to 
gain visibility into how the application behaves and particularly in identifying issues.

OpenShift provides container metrics out-of-the-box and displays how much memory, cpu and network 
each container has been consuming over time. In the project overview, you can see three charts 
near each pod that shows the resource consumption by that pod.

Click on any of the pods (blue circle) which takes you to the pod details. Click on the **Metrics** tab 
to see a more detailed view of the metrics charts.
