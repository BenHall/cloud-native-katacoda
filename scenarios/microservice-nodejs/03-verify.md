In order to access the Web UI from outside (e.g. from a browser), it needs to get added to the load 
balancer. Run the following command to add the Web UI service to the built-in HAProxy load balancer 
in OpenShift.

```
oc expose svc/web
```{{execute}}

```
oc get route web
```{{execute}}

Point your browser at the Web UI route url. You should be able to see the CoolStore with all 
products and their inventory status.

Well done!
