Now that you have a Git repository for the Inventory service, you should push the 
source code into this Git repository.

Go the **inventory-wildfly-swarm** folder, initialize it as a Git working copy and add 
the GitHub repository as the remote repository for your working copy. Make sure you 
replace **GIT-REPO** with the Git repository url in the following commands:

> Paste the Git repository url from the clipboard which you have copied in the 
> previous steps. 

`cd inventory-wildfly-swarm`{{execute}}

`git init`{{execute}}

`git remote add origin http://gogs-infra.app.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/developer/inventory-wildfly-swarm.git`

Before you commig the source code to the Git repository, configure your name and 
email so that the commit owner can be seen on the repository. Replace the name 
and the email with your own in the following commands:

`git config --global user.name "Developer"`{{execute}}

`git config --global user.email "developer@os.com"`{{execute}}

Commit and push the existing code to the GitHub repository.

`git add . --all`{{execute}}

`git commit -m "initial add"`{{execute}}

`git push -u origin master`{{execute}}


Enter your Git repository credentials if you get asked to enter your credentials. 
* Username: **developer**
* Password: **developer**

Go to your **inventory-wildfly-swarm** repository web interface and refresh the page. You should 
see the project files in the repository.
