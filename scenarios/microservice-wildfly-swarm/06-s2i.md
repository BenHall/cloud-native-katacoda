Itâ€™s time to build and deploy our service on OpenShift. 
OpenShift [Source-to-Image (S2I)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build) 
feature can be used to build a container image from your project. OpenShift 
S2I uses the [supported OpenJDK container image](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html/red_hat_java_s2i_for_openshift) to build the final container image of the 
Inventory service by uploading the WildFly Swam uber-jar from the **target** folder to 
the OpenShift platform. 

Maven projects can use the [Fabric8 Maven Plugin](https://maven.fabric8.io) in order 
to use OpenShift S2I for building 
the container image of the application from within the project. This maven plugin is a Kubernetes/OpenShift client 
able to communicate with the OpenShift platform using the REST endpoints in order to issue the commands 
allowing to build a project, deploy it and finally launch a docker process as a pod.
