The **catalog-spring-boot** project shows the components of 
a Spring Boot project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best 
practices. Run the following command to examine the Maven project structure.

`tree`{{execute}}

This is a minimal Spring Boot project with support for RESTful services and Spring Data with JPA for connecting
to a database. This project currently contains no code other than the main class, `CatalogApplication.java`
which is there to bootstrap the Spring Boot application.

Examine **CatalogApplication.java**

The database is configured using the Spring application configuration file which is located at 
**src/main/resources/application.properties**. Examine this file to see the database connection details 
and note that an in-memory H2 database is used in this scenario for local development and will be replaced
with a PostgreSQL database in the following scenarios. Be patient! More on that later.

You can use Maven to make sure the skeleton project builds successfully.

> Make sure to run the **package** Maven goal and not **install** The latter would 
> download a lot more dependencies and do things you don't need yet!

`mvn package`{{execute}}

You should see a **BUILD SUCCESS** in the build logs.

Once built, the resulting **jar** is located in the **target/** directory:

`ls target/*.jar`{{execute}}

The listed jar archite, **catalog-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar** is an uber-jar with all the dependencies required packaged in the **jar** to enable running the application with **java -jar**.

Now that the project is ready, let's get coding and create a domain model, data repository, and a  
RESTful endpoint to create the Catalog service:
